NutriLens was built for Technova. It's an app that connects parents and their children through nutritional transparency. Parents can set dietary settings on the app, then children can scan food barcodes and the app provides specific recommendations based on ingredient list. Along with an indepth ingredient list, Nutrilens also provides safer alternatives, warnings, and analysis of dangerous ingredients powered by ai. Each scan notifies the parent so they are kept updated with the child's scanning activity. 

This app is aimed towards parents who have young children with strict dietary restrictions who may not know to correctly judge food safety on their own yet. This takes the pressure off parents and helps keesp the children safe and healthy !
